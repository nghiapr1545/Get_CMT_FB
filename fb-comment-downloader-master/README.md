Setup
-----

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: this will install [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) and [Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/). These packages are not required if you choose a different server.*

This application is set up to only download comments on posts from a specified public facebook page. You will need to [register and configure a Facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register/). Once you've done this, fill out `config.py` with your information.

To get comment author and reactions info you will need to use a [Page Access token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/#pagetokens) from a user who has admin rights to the page. You can get a token by setting up a [system user](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network/reporting-api/systemuser/).

Be aware of the following restriction: 
> Devmode Apps â€” Apps in Devmode are now rate-limited to 200 calls per hour, per page-app pair, and can only access Users who have a role on the app (admin, developer, or tester).
